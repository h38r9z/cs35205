ECONOMICS 211.02: INTRODUCTION TO MACROECONOMICS             Fall 2024 
Required Text: Gwartney, et al., Macroeconomics; Private and Public Choice (17th ed., 2022) ISBN# 978-0-357-13400-9.
Macroeconomics is the study of the larger scale aggregates in the economy, such as unemployment, output and the price level, and their determinants and interactions. To study macroeconomics, we will build the necessary basic microeconomic tools; expand those tools’ application, including related measurement issues, to the economy as a whole; use those tools to investigate the effects of fiscal policy--government purchases, net taxes, and effects on deficits and debt--and monetary policy; deal with stabilization policy and expectations, economic growth, and aspects of international trade and finance.
After completing this course, students will be able to: understand and apply the core principles of economics, including opportunity cost, marginal thinking, comparative advantage, gains from voluntary exchange, and supply and demand; understand and apply the aggregate supply and demand model, particularly with regard to effects on the price level and inflation, real and nominal output, employment and unemployment; understand and apply the analysis of fiscal policy (government tax and expenditure policy) and monetary policy in the aggregate supply and demand model; and understand differences between schools of macroeconomic thought and the difficulties of stabilization policy, particularly problems of measurement, forecasting, lags, and expectations.
Class meetings will be Tuesdays and Fridays in BPC 189. For each class meeting, students should have read the assigned material and should have the text and other readings and relevant handouts with them. I may also send you Messages (via Courses and/or email) before some class sessions about the material and our class discussions. Be sure to pay close attention to the handouts and the extensive review questions and answers, which increase in frequency and importance as we proceed. They often go substantially beyond the text’s discussion both in organization and application and provide the best idea of what to expect will be emphasized on exams.

Exams will be objective and heavily focused on application; rote memorization of definitions will not be sufficient to do well on the exams. Because of that focus on application, questions are often more difficult than memorization questions, grade cutoffs will reflect that. My expected course grade cutoffs will be roughly 80% for an A; 70% or for a B; 50% for a C; 46% for a C-; 42% for a D. That will apply to each exam and overall in the course.COURSE SCHEDULE
